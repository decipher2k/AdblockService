# AdblockService
<b>Adblocking Windows service</b> based on Steven Black's hostsfile.<br>
This service runs a DNS proxy on localhost and filters out unwanted connections.<br>
The DNS traffic is being filtered and then redirected to Google's DNS server.<br>
Useful if you can't afford a PiHole.<br>
<br>
<b>Please note:</b><br>
Some programs, like antivirus software or VPN's, do redirect DNS traffic.<br>
In this case, you will have to disable DNS redirection for those programs.<br>
Please note that this can lead to DNS leaks when using VPNs.<br>

Due to the fact that most pages are hosting ads on their own servers nowadays, and are only forwarding clicks, an aditional browser based adblocker is advised.
